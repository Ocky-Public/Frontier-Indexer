# Emitters and Transports

The indexer can broadcast the data it processes to external systems in real-time. This is achieved through a combination of **Emitters** and **Transports**.

## Emitters

An `Emitter<I>` is a high-level component that manages the dispatching of data batches to one or more transport implementations. Emitters are designed to be non-blocking; when data is dispatched, the emitter spawns an asynchronous tokio task to handle the delivery, ensuring that the main indexing pipeline is not delayed by network latency.

### How it works

1. **Initialization**: An emitter is created with a list of transports that implement the `Transport<I>` trait for a specific data type `I`.
2. **Dispatching**: The `dispatch` method takes a pipeline name and a batch of items. The batch must implement the `Dispatchable` trait (which is implemented for `Vec<I>` and `HashMap<String, I>`).
3. **Asynchronous Delivery**: The emitter iterates through the batch and calls `Transport::send` on every configured transport. If a transport fails to send a message, a warning is logged, but it does not stop other transports from receiving the data.

### Integration in Handlers

In a handler, an emitter is typically held as an `Arc<Emitter<T>>` and used in the `commit` stage:

```rust
// Example dispatch in a handler's commit method
self.emitter.dispatch("killmails", &batch).await;
```

## Transports

A **Transport** is a specific implementation of a delivery protocol. All transports must implement the `Transport<I>` trait.

### The Transport Trait

To ensure that a transport can handle any data type the indexer might produce, the `Transport<I>` trait requires the implementation to also be a `Router`. A `Router` must implement the `Routing<I>` trait for all supported world and app event types.

This design ensures type safety across the entire pipeline: if a transport is registered for a pipeline, it is guaranteed to know how to handle the specific data types emitted by that pipeline.

### Supported Transports

The indexer currently provides several built-in transport implementations:

- **AMQP**: Sends messages to an AMQP-compatible broker (like RabbitMQ). It uses a topic exchange where the routing key is typically formatted as `indexer.<pipeline>`.
- **NATS**: Publishes messages to a NATS server using a subject prefix.
- **Redis**: Uses Redis Pub/Sub to broadcast events to channels.
- **SocketIO**: Starts an embedded Socket.IO server, allowing web clients to connect and receive real-time updates directly from the indexer.

### Adding a New Transport

To add a new transport:
1. Create a new module in `src/transports/`.
2. Implement the `Routing<I>` trait for the data types you wish to support.
3. Implement the `Transport<I>` trait to define the actual delivery logic.
4. Register the transport in `src/transports/init.rs` so it can be initialized from environment variables.
