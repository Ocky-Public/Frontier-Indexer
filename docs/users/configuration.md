# Container Configuration
This guide describes how to configure the indexer container using environment variables. The indexer requires a [TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com/) database (`timescale/timescaledb-ha:pg17` is the recommended container).

If you are using the repository's local compose workflow, you can copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and start the deployment with `./scripts/compose.sh up -d`. If `.env` is missing, the helper script will also create it from `.env.sample` automatically. The compose file passes the same environment variables documented here and overrides `DB_HOST` to `db` so the indexer connects to the database service over the compose network.

## Database Configuration
These variables are used to connect the indexer to your TimescaleDB database.

> [!Note]
> The ingestion source determines which of the values above are used. As an exmaple, setting gRPC values while `store` is selected as the source will not use the gRPC values.
>
> Importantly only one remote store option will be used at a time in the order they are listed above.
> If `REMOTE_STORE_URL` is set then it will be used even if `REMOTE_STORE_AZURE` is also set.
> The only exception is that if none of the remote store values are set then the default checkpoint store will be used.
> Store Headers can be used with any of the other options.

### Event Emitting
The indexer has the ability to broadcast the data being stored in the database out to other systems using a select number of transport protocols. This section controls the configuration of these transport protocols

### Monitoring
Contains settings that provide logging or metrics about the state of the indexer.

| Variable          | Description                                            | Default        |

Sandbox mode is for testing and development. It allows the indexer to run against custom package IDs instead of the hardcoded network addresses, and can source checkpoint data locally rather than from the network.

| Variable                 | Description                                                                                                                        | Default    |

## Performance Tuning
These settings control how the indexer batches and commits data. The defaults are a reasonable starting point; adjust them if you are seeing lag or high database load.

### Sequential Pipeline

| `WATERMARK_INTERVAL_JITTER_MS` | Random jitter added to the watermark interval to spread out writes when running multiple indexer instances.                                        | `0`     |
| `MIN_EAGER_ROWS`               | Minimum number of rows in a batch before the pipeline will commit early without waiting for `COLLECT_INTERVAL_MS`.                                 | (None)  |
| `MAX_BATCH_CHECKPOINTS`        | Maximum number of checkpoints that can be grouped into a single commit batch.                                                                      | (None)  |
| `PROCESSOR_CHANNEL_SIZE`       | Size of the internal channel between the processor and committer stages. Increasing this allows more checkpoints to be processed ahead of commits. | (None)  |

### Ingestion
Controls how aggresively checkpoint data is fetched.
